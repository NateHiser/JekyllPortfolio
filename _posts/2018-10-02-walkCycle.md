Description: For the final project in my Intro animation course, we were instructed to create a walk cycle animation. I spent almost my entire thanksgiving break working on this assignment. After a minimum of 25 hours working on it, I decided I didn't like the direction it was heading in so I restarted. Instead of doing a normal walk, I chose to do a jaunty walk instead. After another 25 or so hours, I finally turned it in, sleep deprived, and happy.
