Description: For my modeling project in my Animation class, I modeled my favorite childhood toy, a Lego. Keeping in mind I would eventually have to texture it, I modeled a hat to go with it. I was able to revisit my childhood dream, and to create my own personal Lego Mini Figure, of myself. Wearing my favorite hat, and sweater, I was able to at least see what could be. This taught me basic modeling, and texturing.
