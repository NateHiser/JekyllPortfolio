Description: Tale as old as time. Two young kids fall in love, and of course have a best friend who loves photography. Seth Williams, a friend I've known since freshman year of college asked me to be the photographer for him when he proposed to his long time girlfriend, Alison. I was able to spend the day with them rejoicing in God's plan for their lives. I am hopeful for their lives. I was able to take hundreds of photographs for them this day, and loved every second of it.
