Description: This was designed for Voyagers Missions, a ministry being developed by me and two of my close friends. The ministry lies around traveling to popular hiking trails, to minister to people we meet along the trails. The logo went through multiple different phases, and have settled on this. The logo encapsulates the idea of the ministry as a whole.
