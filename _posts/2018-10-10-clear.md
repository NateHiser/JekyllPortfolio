Description: This project challenged me to create a social awareness campaign for something I saw as a problem in society. Knowing many who have dealt with domestic abuse I wanted to create something to show it in a different light. So much abuse can be hidden within words said rather with actual violence. This causes it to be a lot harder to see the signs of abuse. With the help of The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) people can have a guide to help. If you would like to learn more go to www.NCADV.org
